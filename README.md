Architecture questions
- Should the program / shape ?? be part of the Painting data structure?


Aesthetic questions
- Should they have descriptions?
  - would make it much more of an actual art scene??
  - easter egg inside pedestals?


Engine things to get done?
  - text
  - pragmas in shader
  - Begin thinking about good venacular for baking. 
  	if we really want this to be used / be efficient
  	it should contain code that can do things like
  	compute random textures, and save that out, as 
  	well as baking everything else. Lets say you want to do 
  	some global illumination. There should be an easy way to do that
  	with not much extra effort, but can do as much precalculation as possible!



Bugs
Normal Matrix calculation wrong
Planes possibly facing wrong way?


Mechanics?

  - procedurally nested rooms. go into each by sticking your head in, the variations that happen to that box, are applied to each box within them. extra variations happen to each one of those boxes.
  - Constantly save the room you are in, so if another person visits that room you will see them. Maybe even record movements? would feel more magical mroe more people you met the further down you went!

  - Branches woudl have to cross, so you could get super lost but somehow make your way back to the original world? maybe only 36 worlds?
